# 1 Analysis

## 1.1 Scenario Ideation

A user wants to trade items with others via the internet. She requires that the website allows her to register, add items, comment on items, and create transactions.

We have created the Exchange Service as a digital marketplace for the tradeof goods. To offer items for trade, a user must add a new item to the exchange platform. Goods can be exchanged immediately after completingregistration.

## 1.2 Use Case Analysis

A requirements analysis was conducted to determine the goals of the website. To do so, we first brainstormed ideas for how a user may interact with the site based on our own prior experiences with web shops. Next, we analysed competitor websites, such as the Swiss e-commerce websites galaxus.ch and Ricardo.ch, forrealistic design and functionality ideas. We used the gathered information to create various user stories, which we later developed into a stakeholder analysis.

After considering constraints to the project, such as the project's requirements as well as the time and technical skills needed to bring our ideas into fruition, we conducted a feasibility analysis, and determined that our project was both technically feasible and realistic with our project's deadline.

Our requirements analysis concluded in the development of Use Cases which are shown in section 1.3 User Story Writing, 1.4 Acceptance Criteria, 1.5 Stakeholder Analysis, and 1.6 Requirements.

## 1.3 User Stories

### 1.3.1 Client/User (Module Suggestions)

1. As a user, I want to have a Web app so that I can use it on different mobile devices and on desktop computers.
2. As a user, I want to see a consistent visual appearance so that I can navigate easily, and it looks consistent.
3. As a user, I want to use list views so that I can view all data available on the site.
4. As a user, I want to create an account so that I can get access to the Exchange Service.
5. As a user, I want to edit my account so that my data is up to date.

### 1.3.2 Client/User (Our Suggestions)

6. As a user, I want to receive/send messages, so that I can communicate with others on the site.
7. As a user, I want to add items for exchange, so that my goods are available for other users to see.
8. As a user, I want to edit the items I have posted for exchange, so that the current condition of my goods are available for other users to see.
9. As a user, I want to view items for exchange, so that I can see what is available on the site.
10. As a user, I want to exchange my old items for other items that are available for exchange, so that I can complete a transaction.

### 1.3.3 Website Administrator

11. As a Website Administrator, I want to have full stack development authorization access so that I can develop and maintain the website, and database.
12. As a Website Administrator, I want to have the ability to delete all entities on the website.

# 3 Business Logic and API design and Implementation

## 3.1 Data Access

Data for the Exchange Service is accessible on the private Github repository, [https://github.com/UrsinaB/ExchangePlatformV0](https://github.com/UrsinaB/ExchangePlatformV0). Persistent database data is located on the file, "crm.mv.db". Frontend views were created on and are hosted by Budibase.

There is no security authorization required for the frontend to access the backend. We chose to disable security functions to aid in the technical feasibility of the project's development. We do acknowledge, that without token/session access client authentication after registration is not possible.

## 3.2 Business Logic Layer

The business logic for the Exchange Service was created using Spring Data JPA. We created four classes: Client, Item, Comment, and Transaction. Below is a brief explanation of what information was included in each of the layers in the Spring Boot repository.

### 3.2.1 Database Layer

Our database (DB) is an H2, cloud hosted relational database. It stores all the CRUD information collected from our four entities. The data base runs as in memory. To share database information, we uploaded DB files from our individual Codespaces.

### 3.2.2 Data Access/ Persistence Layer

The data layer consists of domains and repositories for each class, along with an Enum class.

**Domain:** The database structure and variables are declared.

**Repository:** Instructions for foreign keys and database table joins.

### 3.2.3 Business / Service Layer

The logic for how a query is to be carried out (CRUD operations) when received from the client.

### 3.2.4 Presentation Layer

The Controller allows for the creation of endpoints for the website's views, and the processing of REST API requests. This layer also receives and sends HTTP requests and includes JSON data in the body.

## 3.3 API

When HTTP requests and responses are sent between the web browser and the webserver an API is used. REST is a widely used standard for facilitating computer-to-computer communication over the internet. REST includes guidelines for a consistent user interface, client-server communication, stateless data transmission, cacheable data, layered systems, and optional code-on-demand. RESTful APIs are those that adhere to the aforementioned standards.

# 4 Frontend implementation

## 4.1 Design

The front-end design of the Exchange Service was created on the low code website, Budibase. Our goal was to developpage views based on our users' requirements. In doing so, we created an Add, View, and Update page for each of our use cases: Client, Item, Comment, Transaction. Additionally, we created Home, and About Us pages to make the user experience feel more authentic. The admin page was created for the deletion of each use case.

The colour scheme of the Exchange Service is based on a 1980s Synthwave colour palette. We chose this fun theme to stand out from the professional pages normally made for school assignments.

Our Front end can be found with this link: https://inttech.budibase.app/app/exchangeservice

**Home Page**

![](RackMultipart20230702-1-ia5zht_html_1415f61998993c7e.png)

_Figure 1. Home Page_

## 4.2 Prototyping

The structure of the website and page forms were created directly from our UML model specifications. Inspirations for the layout and navigation came from our own experiences with developing websites in the past. To increase functionality, we had a beta tester review the site and make suggestions.

## 4.3 Realization of Frontend Functionality

To interface with the internet, a client is used. Front-end development is used to render web applications on the client. An interface is used to convey server requests and responses.

Resources are organized into unique sets of URIs i.e., [http://localhost:8080/clients/register](http://localhost:8080/clients/register), which allows the differentiation of the resources on a server. If a client sends an HTTP request for the endpoint "clients/register" to the server, the request is further routed to the "clients" table of the database while "/clients/comments" would go to the "comments" table of the database. Between the client and the server, the HTTP request can be written as, "POST/clients HTTP/1.1", where POST is the HTTP method for "CREATE" and "clients" is the resource to be accessed.

The body of the HTTP request could include an optional request for a custom payload of JSON-encoded data, i.e., "Accept: application/Json".

After receiving and processing the request, the server formats the result into a response, such as "HTTP/1.1 200 OK." "200 OK" is an HTTP status code; if the web browser returns a 500-level code, a request for a custom payload may be sent back to the server to retry the request.

# 5 Demonstrator

## 5.1 Integration of frontend and backend

The backend communicates data from the database to the client-side browser. It contains connections to the server and the database.

**Server:** Hosted on Github

**Database** : Used to structure collected data, stored in the program's DB files

**Endpoints:** Locations of URI/URL resources used by APIs for accessing those resources

## 5.2 consuming REST APIs from the web service

Below is an example oftwo endpoint locations of the URI/URL resources used by our APIs (routes) for accessing resources.

| **Backend Communication Endpoints** |
 |
| --- | --- |
| **HTTP Request** | **Endpoints** | **Purpose** | **Descriptions** |
| **GET** | /api/items/all | View all clients | Returns all items from the database |
| **POST** | /api/comments/create/{itemId}/{clientId} | Add a comment | Receives requested data from the Add Comment form and creates a new entry in the comments table of the database |

_Table 20. API Endpoint Reference List_

# 6 REFLECTION

Following the rubric of the project's documentation was made easier by having prior experience in website design. Our first few deliverables as a team, such as building a business case, requirements list, and so on, received great feedback. The second stage of the project, creating a usable website structure, proved to be more difficult. First, we had to re-learn how to program in Java, then we had to learn how touse Github Codespaces, set up version control within a Git repository, and learn how to work with Spring Boot.

We are proud of the work that we have done but, if given more time, we would add additional features, such as the creation of session tokens that can be stored long-term in the database and allowing users to delete and modify items, comments, and transactions by ID.

We also regret that we found some aspects of Budibase to be too complicated. Unfortunately, most of the endpoints that were created were not implemented in the front end.
